a. 
i. it won't accelerate what's wrong with u???? the force of gravity holding block A in place will also hold
block B in place if its Fg is significantly more than A's Fg.
ii. it will accelerate hella! the Fg of block A will be overwhelmed by block B's Fg.
b. 
         ^Fn                 ^Ft

         A-->Ft              B
         |                   |
         vFg                 vFg

c. 
If it's an atwood of any kind, it is 2 masses attached to a string.
USE BLOB METHOD PLS.

     
      A B ->Fgb

Fnet = Fgb
ma = mBg
(mA+mB)a = mBg
*a=mBg/(mA+mB)*
